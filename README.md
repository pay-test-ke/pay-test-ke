# YUHESEN – Pioneer in Modular Mobile Robotics Platform​
&emsp;&emsp;As the world's leading manufacturer of modular mobile robot chassis, YUHESEN focuses on providing highly compatible ROS robot development platforms for scientific research and industrial scenarios. Drawing on a decade of technological expertise, we have developed a comprehensive robot chassis matrix encompassing both indoor and outdoor environments. This matrix seamlessly integrates the ROS/ROS2 ecosystem, offering seamless compatibility with Navigation function packages, move_base frameworks, and related Local/Global Planner algorithms. These features empower our customers to swiftly achieve autonomous navigation, path planning, and multi-sensor fusion (e.g., LiDAR, depth camera, ultrasonic radar, millimeter wave radar).

&emsp;&emsp;We have developed a series of mobile robot chassis including differential steering, Ackerman steering, four-wheel-independent-steer and four-wheel-independent-drive(4WIS4WID) and crawler chassis, as well as general UGV and indoor AGV, which are suitable for complex scenarios such as logistics, energy, and security. Our open source development kits (such as OS-mate and OS-rtk) are pre-installed with Ubuntu+ROS/ROS2 systems, support autonomous driving frameworks such as Autoware and Apollo, and provide millimeter-level control accuracy and multi-modal sensor interfaces. Through modular design, automotive-grade safety certification, and API standardization protocols, YUHESEN helps 3,000+ partners around the world lower the development threshold
